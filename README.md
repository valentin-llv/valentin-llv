## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Valentin Le Lievre

I'm currently studying electronic and computer science at Polytech Sorbonne in Paris France but in my free time I like to use my fronted dev skills.

I'm currently working on [MonUFR](https://app.monufr.fr), it's an app dedicated to students of all french universities wich allow students to acces their timetable om thier phones. Check out the Git Repo to see more.

I'm also working with a friend on a game called [WikiChallenge](https://github.com/Valadri-games/WikiChallenge-website.git), it's currently in beta but it will be available soon.

Feel free to reach me on my [LinkedIn account](https://linkedin.com/in/valentin-le-lievre)
